    "\n",
    "It also includes estimates of factors that may contribute to each country's happiness, including economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity, to provide context for the score. Although these factors aren't actually used in the calculation of the happiness score, they can help illustrate why a country received a certain score.\n",
